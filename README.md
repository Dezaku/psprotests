# Palestine Protests
https://psprotests.com
A simple project I wanted to build so that everyone knows where they can stand up for human rights anywhere in the world.
It's a simple table with a search bar for now but I eventually plan on adding more features like:

⦁	Mail notifications
⦁	Google Maps Integration
